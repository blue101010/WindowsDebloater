## Specificity of this tool

The "difference" of this tool is a focus on granularity (1 script for one 1 control) as all-in-one scripts are rapidly impossible to use or obsolete or difficult to use and maintain.
A current profile (TBC) would be the update of the day sequence of each required specic unique control. Obsolete controls would be moved to a deprecated folder.

## Usage

This tool is mainly focused on a **powershell** approach and add others scripts ( batch, powershell, python, ansible ) for reference. Scripts are in <https://github.com/blue101010/Windows10Debloater/tree/master/security/default> directory.

## Credits

This is using various ideas from various initial sources.
With the time I added plenty of variants, modifications and optimizations of my own.
